# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

##Key Features:
1. Tasks can be added by using a Create Task button, on clicking we can enter the task name along with description.
2. The task name and description can be edited.
3. Hitting the refresh button (including hard refresh) in the browser does not cause any changes in the state of the app (works like a regular offline app)
